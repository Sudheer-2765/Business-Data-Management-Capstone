Business Data Management Capstone: Grocery Store Sales & Inventory Analysis

This repository documents the findings and recommendations from a 3-month analysis of a grocery store's sales data. The project's goal was to optimize sales, improve profit margins, and understand shopping trends, culminating in an actionable strategy for inventory management.

Project Overview

The grocery store was facing challenges with inventory management, specifically frequent stockouts of popular items and an unclear understanding of sales trends. This analysis provides a data-driven solution by building an interactive dashboard to visualize performance and offering a new stocking strategy projected to significantly improve sales.

Project Methodology & Findings

1. Data Collection & Cleaning

Data: Collected 3 months of raw sales data from the store's Point-of-Sale (POS) system.

Process: The raw data (in Excel/CSV format) was processed using Python and Pandas. This involved cleaning messy data, standardizing product categories, and structuring the data for analysis in Power BI.

2. Analysis & Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to analyze the 3 months of data. The key findings included:

Top-Selling Products: Identified the top 20% of products that accounted for 80% of sales (Pareto principle).

Peak Shopping Trends: Visualized peak sales times by hour and day of the week.

Stockout Issues: Cross-referenced sales data with inventory logs, confirming that the top 10 most popular items were out of stock 30% of the time.

Business Recommendations & Impact

Based on the analysis, I presented a new inventory stocking strategy to the store management.

Recommendation:

Increase the reorder point for the top 20% most popular items.

Implement a "just-in-time" (JIT) stocking system for high-cost, low-sales-volume items to free up capital.

Projected Business Impact:
This new strategy was projected to reduce stockouts by 15% and, as a direct result, increase overall sales by capturing previously lost revenue.
